BONUS CHALLENGES 🔥
Challenge 1: Write a program to find second largest number in a list without using sort().
Challenge 2: Create a dictionary from two lists (one for keys, one for values).

values = ["Raj", 25, "Mumbai"]
Challenge 3: Remove all duplicates from a list while maintaining order.
pythondata = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1]
